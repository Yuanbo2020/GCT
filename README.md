# GCT: Gated Contextual Transformer for Sequential Audio Tagging
 
# Noiseme dataset

Due to the privacy issues of the Noiseme dataset, we can only release the features and the manual annotations of the Noiseme dataset. The features and the corresponding manually annotated weak and sequential labels can be found <a href="https://github.com/Yuanbo2020/GCT/tree/main/Full_dataset_of_Noiseme" 
target="https://github.com/Yuanbo2020/GCT/tree/main/Full_dataset_of_Noiseme">here</a>.
